title: GitLab Status
summary: |- Update commit status for GitLab repositories.
description: |- 
  This Step updates the commit status for a GitLab repository (repo) of your choice with this build's status. Useful anytime you can not or do not want to provide Bitrise write access to your git repo.
  
  ### Configuring the Step
  
1. The **GitLab API base URL** should be `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/` for cloud-hosted GitLabs. 
2. In the **GitLab private token** Step input, you need to provide an access token you generated in your User Settings on GitLab.
3. The **Repository URL** input is populated automatically with a variable the value of which is taken from the repository field of the Settings of your app.
4. You can also select a specific branch or tag to post the status to, but it's going to be sent to the default branch unless you change it.
5. The **Commit hash** input is filled in by default with the variable inherited from the **Git Clone** Step.
6. The **Target URL** Step input is the URL of the build, which is forwarded to GitHub as the source of the status.
7. The **Context** Step input, allows you to label the status with a name.
8. The input **Set Specific Status** input has a default value of `auto` which reflects the status of the build, but this input allows you to update the commit with any given status, regardless of the outcome of the build.
9. The **Description** input allows you to provide a short description for the status. 
10. Code **Coverage** percent can also be sent from the build to the commit. 
 

  ### Troubleshooting
  
  If you get a 404 response when running the Step, check your token's scope and validity.
  If you use GitHub Enterprise, make sure your API base URL is set to `https://gitlab.local.domain/api/v4`.
  If you do not see your status being reflected, double-check **Repository URL** and **Commit hash** input values.
